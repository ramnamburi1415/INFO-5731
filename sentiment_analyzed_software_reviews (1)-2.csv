Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap.

Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap.

Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

I bought this without knowing it's capabilities
Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024Verified Purchase
So I needed a charger real quick and fast cause my old charger finally hit the hay. Without even reading the reviews or looking at the descriptions. Amazon recommended this, so I bought it right away. The charger caught me by surprise cause I didn't know I got one that has Superfast Charging. I have a S21 and it's battery life is not in the best shape. This really helps a lot and takes at least an hour to fully charge right away. Maybe even less than a hour. I'm satisfied with this purchase!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone

Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

fast charges.  got tired of waiting 3 hours for what is now a 1 hr charge
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024Verified Purchase
Old chargers are not up to New phones high charge rates, so got these faster chargers.  Very good. Very noticable improvement, especially after upgrading to new phone. (As an aside I got the new Samsung A54 that says it only works on T-Mobile and not on Verizon, but NOT SO!  I did extensive research, and Verizon is no longer CDMA, it is LTE, which is next generation GSM (used by rest of world & T-mobile), so they are actually more advanced).  So my A54 was made for Panama, but I just changed the language to English and EVERYTHING worked. Plug in my SIM and I was up and going.  Transferred my 210 apps(!) and still works without problem.  Verizon and T-Mobile share the same network channels & frequencies (except they each have 1 channel the other doesn't, but most of the channels are the same so plenty for it to choose from.)I've had the A54 for 2 months and loving it.  I got it for 2 reasons:It can have 8gig processor ram, and 256 gig memory. BUT NOT THE US VERSION! For some reason, the US version ONLY allows 6 gig ram!  And neither Verizon or Samsung could explain why or find me an 8gig US version.  The other reason, this is the last Samsung phone with a slot for additional memory, so I can add 1TB).  So I had to get an ""unlocked international""  phone, but no problems, works great on Verizon.But I digress - these chargers work great fast charging my new phone.

Great value!

Great value for two chargers with cords. They provide fast charging and the six foot cords are handy.No complaints at this time.

Not faster than my fast charging adapter that comes with my phone
Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024Verified Purchase
Plugged in it. Did not work. But when I plugged it in again later, it worked. But I compared it to the fast charging adapter that came with my phone, and it is 20minutes slower. But I think it is about the same speed or just a little slower than the adapter for the macbook that I have

Fast Charging on Google Pixel 6a  , Included cable feels low Quality
Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024Verified Purchase
I purchased the Type-C charger in question for my Google Pixel 6a which supports fast charging at 18W.The Google Pixel 6a does come with a high quality Type-C to Type-C cable. But like most new smartphones these days they don't supply you a wall charger anymore. That's the person's responsibility to buy the wall charger if they don't already have one that supports fast charging.I found the included cable with the wall charger to be of a low quality and on the thin side. Think about it you got a Wall Charger that can dish out upto 25W worth off power. I highly suggest buying a high quality Type C to Type C cable that is more than capable of handing upto 25W.Myself I'm throwing away the included cables as they feel cheap. I don't see them being able to handle the full 25W of power the Wall Charger is capable of dishing out.Plan on giving the other 25W charger to my mom for her Google Pixel smartphone. She will just have to get her own high quality cable for it.

Charges my phone fast.  It exceeded my expectations.  It's a great buy for two.  Make sure the charging cable is pushed into the charger and it won't disappoint.
